    <h2>About me</h2>
    Welcome to my promotion-website for my graduation project, which I made in the last weeks of my first year in my education at ZLI. I'm in a apprenticeship as a computer scientist. After my first year at ZLI, i will
    work at the adesso. <br>
    This website should be a little promotion for my project.<!--</td>

            <td>My project is a ToDo-Management with many different features. I have decided on this project, because I have often searched a good ToDo-Management, but I've never found a suitable one. If you want to
            visit my project-site, you can click on the button "Start NOW!" above. I hope, my ToDo-Management can help you a lot.</td>
